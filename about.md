My name is Lizzie Rajchel and I’m a second year undergraduate at the University of Calgary. I’m currently working towards a bachelor’s degree in Drama, mostly focusing on acting, directing and costume design as well as a bachelor’s degree in English.

My passions lie in Shakespearean theatre, musical theatre and devised theatre. I’ve worked on musicals such as Annie, Alice in Wonderland and am currently working on Legally Blonde. As well in the last year, I worked on a devised musical called I’ll Be Here. You can read more about these and other projects [here](https://lizzierajchel.com/Theatre/).

I am applying my English skills towards script writing, and am currently working on the script of a modern adaptation of Hamlet called “Flowers for Ophelia”. This is my first film project, but you can read about it more [here](https://lizzierajchel.com/film/).

If you have any questions or ideas/inquiries for a project please find my contact information [here](https://lizzierajchel.com/contact/).
